> Declarative API to listen to events outside of a component

## What issues does it solve?

React synthetic event system doesn't interact completely with plain DOM events. This means that listeners attached using `addEventListener` in your lifecycles hooks will not be in the same phase as the one you declare using React props.

```javascript
React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return {
      isOpened: false,
    }
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    document.body.addEventListener("click", this.close)
  }
  close() {
    this.setState({
      isOpened: false,
    })
  }
  open(event) {
    event.stopPropagation() // will not stop propagation to `document.body`
    this.setState({
      isOpened: true,
    })
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <div onClick={this.open}>
          open
        </div>
        {this.state.isOpened &&
          <div>
            {/* some stuff */}
          </div>
        }
      </div>
    )
  }
})
```

ReactHigherEvent solves this issue by using the React event system and making it accessible declaratively anywhere. Just pass your listener to `ReactHigherEvent` props, and it will work!

## Install

```console
$ npm install --save react-higher-event
```

## Import

```javascript
// ES5/commonJS
var ReactHigherEvent = require("react-higher-event")
// ES6
import { ReactHigherEvent, ReactHigherEventContainer } from "react-higher-event"
```

## Usage

### ReactHigherEventContainer

Put this component at the root of your app so that it can listen to events at the top.

> NOTE: You can pass some style/className to ensure it covers the whole document

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactHigherEventContainer>
    {/* my components */}
  </ReactHigherEventContainer>
)
```

### ReactHigherEvent

Use this component where you want to listen to higher events:

```javascript
<ReactHigherEvent
  onClick={this.handleGlobalClick}
>
  { /* note that you will probably want to stopPropagating at the top level of your component */ }
  <div onClick={ (event) => event.stopPropagation() }>
    helloworld
  </div>
</ReactHigherEvent>
```
